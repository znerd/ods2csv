This is ods2csv, a Java-based utility for converted ODS-documents to
CSV-text. ODS stands for "OpenDocument Spreadsheet", while CSV means
"Comma-Separated Values".

The converter can be accessed in several ways:

   - directly via the Java class Converter, which takes input from an
     InputStream and produces output via an OutputStream;

   - an Apache Ant task allows easy integration with Ant-based projects;

   - a command line program makes integration with other UNIX-like programs a
     breeze.

This utility program has no external dependencies other than the Java
runtime environment, verion 1.5 or higher.

This software requires the following to build:

   - J2SE 1.5 or Java SE 6
   - Ant 1.7.1

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied LICENSE file.

This task comes as a collection of Java source files that can be built with Ant.
Just run:

   ant

The result will be a JAR file:

   build/ods2csv.jar

Example usage on the command line:

   java -jar build/ods2csv.jar < sheet5.ods > sheet5.csv

Example usage of the task in an Ant build file:

   <taskdef name="ods2csv"
       classname="com.pensioenpage.jynx.ods2csv.ConverterTask"
       classpath="lib/ods2csv.jar" />

   <ods2csv dir="src/ods" todir="build/csv" />

Although all parameters are optional, the task supports various:

   dir      - the source directory, to read ODS files from, defaults to
              the project base directory;

   todir    - the destination directory, to write the generated CSV files to,
              defaults to the source directory;

   includes - the files in the source directory to include, defaults to
              '*.ods';

   excludes - the files to exclude, even if they are matched by the includes;

and other parameters inherited from the MatchingTask, see:
